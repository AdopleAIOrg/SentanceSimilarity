# Sentence Similarity Checker
A Python application that calculates the similarity score between two sentences using the Spacy library.

# **Description**
The Sentence Similarity Checker is a Python application that allows you to compare the similarity between two sentences. It uses the Spacy library, specifically the "en_core_web_md" model, to analyze and compute the similarity score.

# **Features**

> **Sentence Similarity Calculation:** The application calculates the similarity score between two sentences. It utilizes the Spacy library and its "en_core_web_md" model to perform natural language processing and compute the similarity score.

> **Efficient Similarity Score Calculation:** The SentenceSimilarity class efficiently computes the similarity score between two sentences by leveraging the pre-trained word vectors in the Spacy model. This allows for accurate and fast comparison of sentences.

> **Streamlit User Interface:** The application provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. Users can easily input the sentences and view the similarity score on a web browser without the need for complex setup or coding.

# **Installation**

**Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/AdopleAIOrg/SentanceSimilarity.git

# Usage
1. Run the application:
   
       !streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501

2. Access the application by opening the provided URL in your web browser.

3. Enter the first sentence in the designated text area.

4. Enter the second sentence in the designated text area.
